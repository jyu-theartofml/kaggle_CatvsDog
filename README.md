# kaggle_CatvsDog
<p>This has been a Kaggle tradition since 2013 - a classifier that can confidently distinguish between cat and dog! The evaluation function is the log loss function that takes into account how confident the prediction is. In this code, pretrained VGG16 was fine tuned on 6,000 training examples and validated on 2,000 examples in a similar manner as the Keras tutorial (https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html).
