# kaggle_CatvsDog
<p>This has been a Kaggle tradition since 2013 - a classifier that can confidently distinguish between cat and dog! The evaluation metric is the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/LogarithmicLoss">log loss function </a> that takes into account how confident the prediction is. In this code, pretrained VGG16 was fine tuned on 12,500 training examples and validated on 3,000 examples in a similar manner as the Keras tutorial (https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html). The Convolution Network was ran on Amazon EC2 g2.2xlarge instance, with AMI cs231n_caffe_torch7_keras_lasagne_v2 from Standard's Convolutional Neural Network Course, this AMI comes with Theano, CUDA v7.5, CUDNN v3. This Python algorithm obtained a leaderboard logloss score of 0.29859 for the test data. Further optimization is still in process.

Note: other pretrained models in Keras Application portals had image size requirement that didn't fit in memory. When configuring the AMI from Standford, it's necessary to upgrade Keras and configure Jupyter Notebook browser access.
